 * The derived class should implement:
 * - A `print_name()` method for logging purposes (if logging is enabled).
 * - Optionally override `process_stage()` to perform stage-specific logic.

 * The pipeline stage represented by this class receives data from a preceding pipeline
 * register, processes it, and holds it until the next pipeline register is ready to accept it.
 * Logging behavior can be toggled by setting the `logged` flag.
